**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

As data scientists and machine learning professionals, our work goes beyond helping companies, governments, and businesses grow financially. The people who will be using the technologies we develop should always be our top priority. Therefore, ethics and equity must always be considered.
The first component that comes to mind is cultural sensitivity. When developing an application or system, we must consider the diverse populations we are serving. For example, in the name sections, it’s important not to limit the number of characters, as some countries have longer names, or to include middle names, as some regions have many individuals with similar names. Another example is facial recognition technology, which may not recognize features of certain ethnicities, or voice recognition software that may fail to accurately recognize women’s voices.
The issue lies in the design of the application or system. We must ensure that the criteria are adjusted appropriately and involve people from the relevant cultures to better understand their needs and create an inclusive final product.
In addition to cultural sensitivity, it is crucial to design a final product that is both inclusive and compliant with diversity standards. For example, we should create tools that enable people with disabilities to access the service seamlessly. Likewise, in the gender section, it's important to include options for individuals who identify as non-binary. The same consideration should apply to people who are stateless or from regions where their countries are not internationally recognized.
Moreover, other essential components, such as data protection, privacy, and security, should always be prioritized to ensure that the system is ethical and responsible.
